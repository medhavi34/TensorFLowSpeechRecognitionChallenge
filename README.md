To build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands effectively 

I reformulate the audio clips into three different types of spectrogram; a visual representation of the signal strength of the audio clips. 
The spectrograms that I chose to convert my audio clips are the following:  
* Spectrogram 
* Mel Spectrogram 
*	MFCC Spectrogram 

For my Deep Learning endeavor, I used FastAI and PyTorch primarily. FastAI is a deep learning library built on Pytorch to get state-of-the-art results.
